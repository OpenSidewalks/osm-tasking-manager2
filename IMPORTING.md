How to import
=============
* Borrowed from (LABuildings Import)[https://github.com/osmlab/labuildings]
* Import Instructions needs further updating

## Getting started

### Creating an import account

 * OSM best practices require that you [do not use your normal OSM account for the imports](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Import/Guidelines#Use_a_dedicated_user_account). Create a new account for this purpose. 
 Usually, it's your existing OSM username followed by `_imports` (e.g. `jess_imports or jess_seattlesidewalks)`.
 Post your import account username in this ticket
[//]: <> (http://github.com/osmlab/labuildings/issues/40)

### Getting familiar with JOSM

To contribute to this project, you need to use the JOSM editor.  Here are some resources to get you started:
 * LearnOSM - http://learnosm.org/en/josm/
 * Mapbox Mapping wiki - https://www.mapbox.com/blog/making-the-most-josm/

### Check out a task on the tasking manager

 * Tasks will be available on **[http://tasks.opensidewalks.com](http://tasks.opensidewalks.com)**.
 * Priority: we are working on the City of Seattle first, which is broken down by census block groups. Each task performed is one block group within the city boundaries.
 * Why? Because different parts of the county have different data problems to watch out for. If we all run into the same problems at the same time, it will be easier for us to help each other and improve the processing scripts and the import workflow.

## Import workflow


### Activating JOSM Remote Control
 * Open JOSM and activate JOSM Remote Control. In the JOSM menu, for Windows, select **Edit > Preferences...** or press `F12`. For Mac, select **JOSM > Preferences...** or press, `âŒ˜,`.
 * Click on the remote control icon.
 * Select **Enable Remote Control** and click **OK**.

### Adding Bing imagery background
 * From the **Imagery** menu, select **Bing aerial imagery**.

### Selecting a task in the Tasking Manager
 * Choose which area you want to work on from **[http://tasks.opensidewalks.com](http://tasks.opensidewalks.com)** and click **Start Mapping**.
 * Download current data in OSM by clicking **Edit in JOSM**.
 
![download_osm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/353700/14101327/6f8b279a-f5b1-11e5-83ef-b28d00afca62.gif)
 
 * This will load the existing data from OpenStreetMap (`Data Layer 1`) and another background layer for the boundaries of the task (`Tasking Manager - #2`).  You will work only within the task boundary.
 
 * Get the `.osm` file you will import by clicking the link in the **Extra Instructions**.  This will download a new layer in JOSM.
   At least two layers should be in JOSM: one with the imported data (`sidwalks-####.osm`), one with current OSM data (`Data Layer 1`).

### Reviewing the data before uploading

 * Using the aerial imagery check that crossings are accurate.
 * Ensure new geometries are not running into existing features.
 * Make sure sidewalks connect to crossings.
 * Connect way endpoints to adjacent data if it exists.
 * Review both data layers for possible conflicts.
 * Examine tags in both data sets to see if there are any conflicts.
 * If there are any problems you don't know how to deal with, do not proceed. Instead, flag the `.osm` file for a more advanced user to look at. 
 (Use github [issues](http://github.com/osmlab/labuildings/issues) to flag concerns, and/or create 
 [OSM notes](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Notes)). Then unlock your task on the tasking manager and pick a new area to work on.

* Preserve the work of previous mappers wherever possible.  If existing sidewalks in OSM are of higher quality:
  * Copy the tags from the import layer version.
  * Delete the sidewalks from the import layer.
  * Switch to the OSM layer.
  * Select the sidewalk and paste the tags.

* If the imported data is of higher quality, select both sidewalks and use the **Replace geometry** tool.

 *  Run JOSM Validator, and if there are errors, fix them.

### Finally, upload it

* Select both layers by shift-clicking them both.

* Right-click the layers and click Merge.

* Merge onto the `sidewalks-...osm` layer.

* Click the Upload button, the green up arrow button.

* If you see a "Suspicious data found" warning, click "Continue upload"

* Use the **changeset comment**: `Seattle Sidewalk Import #seattlesidewalks http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Seattle,_Washington/Sidewalk_Import` 
 and **source**: `City of Seattle, https://data.seattle.gov/`.

![screen shot 2016-04-02 at 3 53 17 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3673236/14229620/ad73128c-f8ec-11e5-9e2f-44d272bd6403.png)

If you see an Authorization window asking you to log in to OpenStreetMap, log in and remember to use your `_import` username.

* Go back to the Tasking Manager and click **Mark task as done**.  Another mapper will validate your edits.

## What to watch out for

### Validate the import with your eyes before uploading!

 * Run the [JOSM validator](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JOSM/Validator). Check for any errors it detects.

 * Inspect everything else with a critical eye! Don't trust that the validator or FIXME tags will catch everything. There may be other bugs that only you can detect. Use your human smarts!
 
### Conflating with existing data
 * Look for any overlaps with existing buildings. Existing buildings in OSM are probably _more_ up-to-date than our imported data. Do not assume the imported data is better, mostly likely it is worse! 
 * Carefully combine the import data with the existing OSM data. If you aren't sure about some tags, ask someone! Especially ask the original mapper! 
 
### How to ground-truth the data
 * Up-to-date aerial imagery... try several sources.
 * See if the street is on [Mapillary](http://www.mapillary.com/).
 * Go out and check it out yourself! Take a field trip!
 * **DO NOT USE GOOGLE MAPS OR GOOGLE STREET VIEW**.
